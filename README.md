⚠️CODE UPDATE ⚠️:

⚠️Use ref should be:
export const useRef  = function (dir) { return container.collection.get(dir); };  

⚠️And the usage should be:
useRef(context.router).navigate('/') (inside an arrow function)

⚠️We will talk about the issue that we currently have in the next episode:

INFO:

In the fourth episode of commit.js we'll talk about routing in Single Page Applications (SPAs). We will develop a simple router that will present different components based on a configuration object. Later in the episode we will explore webpack code splitting and lazy loading.

In the next couple of series we will be developing our own Angular like library that will speed up our development process.

The event will be broadcasted on youtube:
